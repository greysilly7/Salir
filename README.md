# Salir
This mod gets files from ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/`` and picks a random one and each time the server is pinged for its status randomizes it

## SETUP
1. Create ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/`` (Optionally it will be created on server start)
2. Place any PNGs you want inside ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/``
3. Done. Profit. Donzo.

Server doesn't need to be restarted for new images to take effect
