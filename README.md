This mod gets files from ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/`` and picks a random one and each time the server is pinged for its status randomzies it

# SETUP
1. Create ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/``
2. Place 64x64 PNGs inside it like you normally would with server icons, FILENAME doesnt matter
