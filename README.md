This mod gets files from ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/`` and picks a random one and each time the server is pinged for its status randomizes it

## SETUP
1. Create ``<MINECRAFT_SERVER_ROOT>/server-icons/`` (Optionally it will be created on server start)
2. Place 64x64 PNGs inside it like you normally would with server icons, FILENAME doesn't matter

Server doesn't need to be restarted for new images to take affect
